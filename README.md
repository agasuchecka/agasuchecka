# 👩🏻‍💻 About Me
My name is Agnieszka, and I am a *Software Tester*. In 2018 I graduated from university with a Master’s degree in English studies. After graduating, I worked briefly as an English teacher and then moved to a corporate job in clinical trials documentation. In the meantime, I was also doing some translation and proofreading. I entered the world of IT as a Service Desk Agent and then promptly switched to a Technical Writer job. My mind was then already set on Software Testing, so I soon took an opportunity to become a Manual Tester of mobile applications. Currently, I continue to work in testing and develop towards test automation. I am a highly motivated, ambitious and well-organised person with strong attention to detail. I am curious about the world and new technology, and I always enjoy learning new things. I value good organisation and creativity. Likewise, I enjoy working in a team in an international environment.
